            "[\"RENT A STEAM CLEANER. The location is very, very inconvenient, but I am sure that is nothing they can help, it is just how the city has grown around their location. I would have rated the room as a 4 or 5 for clean if the sofa was not so disgusting. I literally covered it with a sheet just to sit on it. There was not one inch of surface that was not covered with a greasy/dirty stain. I would have switched rooms if I hadn't already unloaded all of my stuff in the rain before I turned on the lights to reveal the nasty sofa. Otherwise, the room was clean and comfortable. It would be worth a couple of hundred dollars to get a steam cleaner and clean the sofas in each room. Not to mention how unsanitary it is\", \"Great hotel and staff - recommend. I came in late after a long drive from Vegas ending in a whole lot of highway exits and concentration to get to Napa. I was greeted by a friendly night staff who was expecting me, and (not sure of his name) made me feel more relaxed immediately. I even got a little welcome pack with a snack and water. That was much appreciated.Breakfast was not included, fruit and granola bars were out in the lobby. A hotel discount was offered at the friendly Denny's next door. My room was quiet and all 3 of the morning staff were incredibly helpful the next morning helping me map out my day of driving, and helping me choose and book my next hotels. The hotel is a convienent location, not too far off the main highway. Near all services and malls if needed.We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us and look foward to seeing you on your next visit to the Napa Valley\", \"comfy place. We were greeted by the front desk when we arrived 3 hours prior to our check in. We were treated with respect. She guided us where we can have meals and stored our luggage. The rooms were given as early as it was ready. Loved that the room did not have carpets for allergy sufferers. Clean room. Close to Sea world and Old town. Loved the stay. Here at the Ramada Limited San Diego/Near SeaWorld, we love to accommodate. We're delighted that you got to experience the extraordinary hospitality of our team. As you noted, our location is perfect for taking in the sights of San Diego, and it is great to hear that you took advantage. Thank you for the five-star review, and we hope to see you again soon\", \"Unhappy Guest. Illegal activity going on the parking lot when we arrived. There was women standing next to motels doors waiting to be served or get served no working vending machines for a soft drink. Black mold growing in the ceiling of our room. The room stunk terribly. There were holes all in the walls and they were patched with thin metal plates. My husband stepped on something and come to find out, it was an extention cord running underneath the carpet, from the out side to the air conditioner inside. We wedged two chairs next to the door because it would not shut properly. The shower head was about to fall out. We felt gross even after a bath. We slept fully dressed because I didn't want any of body parts touching the bed\", 'Perfect family suite. Staff very friendly and informative, even before being asked. 2 room king suite exceeded expectations. Comfortable beds and plenty of linens at check in.Dear 57crystalcThank you for your kind words regarding your stay at the Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central. We were glad to have you as our guest, and appreciate you taking the time to comment regarding your visit with us. We look forward to the opportunity to host you again the next time you are in the Dallas area. Thanks again for being our guest. Best regards, Charlie Westhoven Operations Manager Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central', \"Great service and location. We were given a beautiful room overlooking Pike's Market and the Bay. Nice size rooms and wonderful bathroom. Staff was welcoming and remembered our names as we went in and out of hotel. Well located for all public transportation and restaurants. In the middle of all the best shopping. Walked everywhere or took public transportation wherever we needed to go.Thank you for taking the time to review the Grand Hyatt Seattle. Our hotel is perfect for the recreation or business travel and is conveniently located to public transportation and many Seattle attractions. I am pleased to hear that our location, guest rooms and friendly staff made your stay enjoyable. Lindye W.Guest Relations Manager\", 'I almost got sick when I saw the room. This is one of those things that I actually can semi laugh about at this time, but it sickens me still. I am very clean and neat as a pin. We needed a layover as we were moving items from our NY home to our NJ home. We had a rental truck booked and it was about 11:00 pm when. More', \"great holiday. Pluses: location, all suites Minuses: Rude and unhelpful staff, worst breakfast selection and coffee quality of any Embassy Suites I've ever stayed in\", \"Great Hyatt property, a little pricey. The hotel is great, the rooms have been updated. My TV came well appointed with a new LG LED TV that was probably 50 inches, a stand alone shower with a separate bath tube. The furniture and the room are well maintained, and the hotel itself has kept current with its decor. The hotel has a nice gym, pool, and all the other things that make a Grand Hyatt a Grand Hyatt. The valet was very quick with the car which is always fantastic. My only pet peeve is that there are a Starbucks and small shop attached to the property, but they do not take room charges. When you are connected to the hotel, in the hotel's actual building, you should take room charges\", \"Very nice old city vibe. Surrounded by new urban buildings, this hotel/motel is a diamond in the rough. The exterior is clean, quaint, and the grounds are lush with flowers and shrubs in the small space the hotel occupies. Our room was clean and bathroom has been updated with modern fixtures. The room, including the bathroom, is very small with little room to spread out. I wasn't impressed with the mattress. It seemed to be either old or poor quality.maybe both. The included breakfast wasn't fancy or abundant with choices but the quality of the items provided was very good. All in all this hotel is very clean and the employees we encountered were very nice. Price was right for location, quality, and amenities.Hi fadedbjulejeans,Our entire team would like to thank you for staying at our property. We apologized for not exceeding your expectations. We will use your reviews for us to improve on those areas. We hope you consider staying with us again\"]\n",
